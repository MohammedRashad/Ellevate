Question: What are the main issues in terms of cross cutting matters?
Answer: Based on the provided context, I refined the original answer to better address the query:

According to the context information, the main issues in terms of cross-cutting matters are:

* Cross-cutting issues have not been taken into account neither in the project design nor during the implementation stage.
* The implementing partner did not ensure a gender equality strategy.
* No gender-disaggregated data was present in project documents and final report.
* There is no mention of environmental or social environment considerations.
* The project lacked structured internal monitoring activities, which affected the sustainability of the benefits of the outputs.

The additional context provided did not introduce new cross-cutting issues, but rather highlighted the importance of addressing these existing gaps in future projects.
