Question: : What are the main issues in terms of cross cutting matters?
Answer: Based on the provided context, the main issues in terms of cross-cutting matters appear to be related to:

1. **Access to information**: There is a need for improvement in terms of access to information about the reforms and public awareness on the necessity of the current reforms of the child protection system in Armenia, particularly in rural areas. This is exacerbated by the lack of visibility of EU financial support to the project, despite following EU visibility minimum requirements.

2. **Stakeholder engagement and coordination**: The project faces challenges in terms of stakeholder engagement, particularly with government institutions, such as the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MoLSA) and the Yerevan municipality, which hinders the smooth implementation of activities and coordination between state bodies responsible for child care.

3. **External factors**: The project is vulnerable to external factors such as political crises, frequent changes in key decision-makers, and global events like the COVID-19 pandemic and armed conflicts, which can jeopardize the project's outcomes and impact.

These cross-cutting issues affect multiple aspects of the project, including the target groups, beneficiaries, and stakeholders, and need to be addressed to ensure the project's success.
