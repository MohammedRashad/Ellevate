Question: What have been the main Relevance issues?
Answer: Based on the additional context provided, I can refine the original answer to better address the query.

The main relevance issues affecting the project's success can be inferred as:

1. **Poor project design and management**: The project logframe showed several shortcomings, including mixed outcomes and outputs, repetition in formulation, and unclear indicators. Additionally, the lead applicant did not sufficiently monitor the components implemented by the consortium partners or local sub-grant recipients, instead performing micro-management duties.
2. **Insufficient monitoring and reporting mechanisms**: The lead applicant's monitoring and reporting mechanisms were deemed insufficient, which affected the project's accountability to the donor.
3. **Covid-19 pandemic and Nagorno-Karabakh conflict**: These external factors significantly impacted the project's success, causing delays, limiting beneficiaries' access to project outputs, and affecting the sustainability of benefits.
4. **Limited experience exchange and partnership building**: The project missed opportunities for experience exchange among sub-grant recipients and did not conduct sufficient seminars to support partnership building between Armenia and Georgia.

These relevance issues are highlighted throughout the document as key challenges that affected the project's overall success and sustainability.
