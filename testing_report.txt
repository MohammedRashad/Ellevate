Question: : What are the main issues in terms of cross cutting matters?
Answer: Based on the additional context, the refined answer is:

The main issues in terms of cross-cutting matters are:

* Lack of consideration of cross-cutting issues (environment, gender balance, social environment) in the project design and implementation stage. Specifically, there is no mention of environmental considerations in the project plan.
* No gender equality strategy was ensured by the implementing partner, Yerevan School of Civic Studies (YSCS), which is a significant oversight given the project's focus on promoting fight against corruption, tourism for economic growth, and anti-discrimination.
* No gender-disaggregated data was present in project documents and final report, which limits the understanding of the project's impact on different gender groups.
* Insufficient consideration of the needs of target groups and beneficiaries, particularly in terms of cross-border events and cooperation between young people from Armenia and Georgia.

These issues indicate that the project did not adequately address important cross-cutting concerns, particularly gender balance, social environment, and environmental considerations.

Question: What have been the main Relevance issues?
Answer: Based on the provided context, I can refine my previous answer to better address the query about "Relevance issues".

Upon reviewing the context, I didn't find any explicit mention of "Relevance issues". However, I can infer that the context is related to a project evaluation, and the relevance of the project's outcomes and activities might be implied.

In this context, potential "Relevance issues" could be related to the project's ability to address the core causes and ways of improvements for tourism, anti-discrimination, and anti-corruption in Armenia and Georgia. The project's outcomes and indicators might be relevant to these issues, but the context doesn't explicitly mention any relevance issues.

However, some potential relevance issues could be:

1. The project's focus on tourism for economic growth might not be relevant in the short term due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Nagorno-Karabakh hostilities, which have severely impacted the tourism sector.
2. The project's emphasis on anti-discrimination and anti-corruption initiatives might not be directly relevant to the current priorities of the Armenian and Georgian governments or other stakeholders.
3. The project's reliance on the YSCS network for visibility and communication might limit its relevance and impact beyond this network.

To better understand the "Relevance issues" in this context, it would be helpful to have more information about the project's objectives, target groups, and stakeholders.
